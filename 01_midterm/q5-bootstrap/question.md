What screen sizes in name and size are supported by bootstrap?

Please describe what would be the output of the following code snippet on mobile phone and on desktop computer, when using Twitter Bootstrap?  What would you expect to see?

```
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Ruby Red</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Navy Blue</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Lime Green</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Egg Nog</div>
    </div>
```


extra small <576 px 
small >=576px
medium >=768px

On a mobile phone they would all be stacked on top of each other
On a desktop computer they would be 4 in a row spread out evenly
