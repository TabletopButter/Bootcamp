### Answers:


A.  Sweet Halwa  text is blue, because it is the first highlighted element with the class highlight inside of the ul list with teh class of shopping list therefore it is odd applying the blue color

B.Sausage has a blue text color because the id selector in css is more specific therefor it will over ride the red color of the ul li elements
