1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?


1. git pull is acutally a git fetch combined with a get merge(Fetches and merges changes), while get fetch just fetches

2. You use the git add command to include updates to the particular file/folders you are working in, and include  them in the next commit
