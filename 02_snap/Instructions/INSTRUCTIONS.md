##### Saturday, Dec 19th, 2020

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Make sure you put your phone on silent ;-)

1. Git clone this `Students_Sep_2020_Reviews` folder to your computer. If you already have it from the previous mid-term, then `git pull` within this repository's folder.

1. Copy this `02_midterm` folder over to your personal repository within github.com:ACCSoftwareBootcamp, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Sep_2020_Reviews/02_midterm`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/02_midterm`

    
1. There's a folder for each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder, only within a file or files named `answer.md` or `answer.js` to receive credit.

1. This review is in 2 parts:

    1. **Multiple choice questions**. These have equal weight and total upto 60% of the credit. These test your knowledge, but more so test you understanding of the concepts. If you do not know the answer, allocate a few minutes and try to understand what is being asked, research it and explain in brief why you chose the answer.

    2. **Short questions**.  These questions test your understanding and your ability to research and compose an answer. They would grant you 40% of the grade. Please answer only 1 question out of the ones given. You may attempt the other questions at a later time for your practice. Only the first attempted question would be considered.

1. This review is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. 

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

1. Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository.  There would be no grace time given after 9:00 am. Hence, please do complete as much as you can and commit/push your answers on or before time.


### INTEGRITY: 

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#midterm** such that all students have access to the same clarification. 


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of your ability to follow instructions.

1. Evidence of your ability to explain your answer(s) through comments within code or through free form text as requested.

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question.

1. Does your code work, where applicable?


### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for overall success. 

1. You may take upto 1 hour on the review day to complete the review. Please remember to commit/push your answers within the time allotted. You may take additional time after that to complete your answers for learning and experimentation purposes. However, only your answers committed before the specified time would be evaluated.

1. Credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions.
